#PhalconBlog

This is a test project, a blog engine based on Phalcon Framework 2.
It helps me understand the PF2. :)

In fact this application is very-very-very basic:

 - with the views (bootstrap template) and
 - with the models (with mysql query) and
 - with the controllers (with redis!!) aaaaaaaaaand

 - without admin application :(
